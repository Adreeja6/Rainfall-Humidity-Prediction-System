# Rainfall-Humidity-Prediction-System
This project is a Flask-powered web application designed to predict rainfall probability using a Random Forest model and estimate humidity levels with a Linear Regression model. Trained on historical weather data, the system enables users to input key meteorological parameters—such as wind speed, wind direction, cloud cover, and pressure—to generate accurate forecasts. 

# 📌Project Overview

✅ Predicts Rainfall based on wind speed, wind direction, cloud coverage, and pressure.

✅ Predicts Humidity using the rainfall prediction as an additional input.

✅ Uses Machine Learning models trained on real-world weather data.

✅ Built with Flask for a simple and interactive web interface.
